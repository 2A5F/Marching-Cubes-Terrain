# Marching-Cubes-Terrain
This is my implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm using Unity.

## Features
  - **Unity Job System with the Burst Compiler**
  - Realtime terrain editing
  - Procedurally-generated infinite world

## System Requirements
  - Unity3D (I'm developing this project with version **2019.3.0f6**, but any newer version should also work)

## Setup
  1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Terrain.git`
  2. Open the project with Unity
 
## Credits:
- Paul Bourke for an example implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm (http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/)
