# Marching-Cubes-Improved
This is my implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm in Unity.

### System Requirements
- Unity Editor (I'm developing this project with version **2019.1.0f2**, but any newer version should also work)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Improved.git`
2. Open the project with Unity

### Credits:
- Paul Bourke for an example of the Marching Cubes algorithm (http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/)
- Ashley Davis for the camera script (https://gist.github.com/ashleydavis/f025c03a9221bc840a2b)
- Jordan Peck for the noise library (https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise_CSharp)
